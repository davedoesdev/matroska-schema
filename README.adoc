Replacement for https://github.com/oeuillot/node-matroska/blob/master/lib/schema.js[`schema.js`] from
https://github.com/oeuillot/node-matroska[node-matroska], which is GPL-licenced.

This version is automatically generated from the Matroska

This schema is in link:schema.js[].

To generate it on your own machine, run link:gen_schema.sh[]. You'll need Node.js and wget.
The script will complain if the result differs from node-matroska's schema.
